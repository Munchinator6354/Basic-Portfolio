        <!--I need to put 5-6 images here and label them accordingly, whatever that means, I don't know if this references actually planned projects or made up ones. These should be clickable images with a teal partially transparent banner positioned over them with their title.-->

        <div> Project 1 

        </div>

        <div> Project 2 

        </div>

        <div> Project 3 

        </div>

        <div> Project 4 

        </div>

        <div> Project 5 

        </div>

        <div> Project 6 

        </div>

        <p> These Projects need to be images with a teal banner overlaid on them with a title on the banners describing the project. Are these supposed to be upcoming projects in the class? Or made-up examples? Unsure currently.</p>
        <p>Ryan Could not locate Panopto video with lesson on how to position elements. Would appreciate help finding that info.</p>
